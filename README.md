## Overview

The challenge was to build a functional conference ticket generator that closely matches the provided design screenshots. No Figma files were provided, which meant recreating the layout by visually interpreting static images. The project is responsive across screen sizes—from desktop to mobile—and was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and Vite.

## My Process

### Built With

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Flexbox)
- HTML5
- Vite

### What I Learned

The biggest takeaway from this project was the challenge of replicating detailed layouts without a Figma file—similar to working with a client who can't provide full specs but expects pixel-perfect results.

One key feature I implemented was a drag-and-drop avatar uploader using [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/). Another challenge was managing and transferring form data between components in React, which deepened my understanding of state lifting and props.
